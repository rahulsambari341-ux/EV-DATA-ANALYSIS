This project analyzes the **Electric Vehicle (EV) Population dataset** provided by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). The dataset includes details about Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) registered in Washington.

## üìä Project Overview

The goal of this project is to clean, explore, visualize, and model EV data to understand adoption patterns, vehicle characteristics, and regional trends.

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handled missing and zero values in `Base MSRP` and `Electric Range`.
   * Removed duplicate records.
   * Anonymized VINs while keeping them unique.
   * Cleaned and formatted vehicle location data.

2. **Data Exploration**

   * Identified the top 5 EV makes and models.
   * Analyzed EV distribution by county and city.
   * Studied adoption trends over different model years.
   * Calculated average electric range and base MSRP by model.
   * Checked percentage of vehicles eligible for CAFV incentives.

3. **Data Visualization**

   * Bar chart: Top 5 EV makes and models.
   * Heatmap/choropleth: EV distribution by county.
   * Line graph: EV adoption by year.
   * Scatter plot: Electric range vs. Base MSRP.
   * Pie chart: CAFV eligible vs. non-eligible vehicles.
   * Geospatial map: Registrations by vehicle location.

4. **Linear Regression Model**

   * Built a model to predict **Electric Range** using `Model Year`, `Base MSRP`, `Make`, and `Model`.
   * Achieved **R¬≤ ‚âà 0.93**, showing strong prediction accuracy.
   * Found that base MSRP and make/model have strong influence on range.
